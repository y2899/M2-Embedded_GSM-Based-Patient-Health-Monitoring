` `**REQUIREMENTS:**

`   `**INTRODUCTION:**

- GSM based Patient Health Monitoring Project mainly works for allowing doctors or relatives of patient to check the status of patient health remotely. 
- The system calculates the heartbeats and body temperature of patient and if it goes above certain limit then immediate informative alert message will be sent to the registered number. 
- For this system we used AVR Family Microcontroller which is interfaced with LCD display, heartbeat sensor, temperature sensor.
- The GSM based Patient health monitoring system works with GSM modem to send the data remotely to the registered number, system powered by 12V transformer. 
- The system also featured with manual health button using that the patient with some other issues will also able to contact with doctor so, the system is very helpful for saving life of patient. 
- The system also introduced a function through which a doctor will able to check the status of patient after a certain interval of time by sending message. 
- The system efficiently updates doctor about health of patient as well as accurately calculates the health parameter of patient.

**OBJECTIVE:**

- GSM based Patient Health Monitoring Project mainly works for allowing doctors or relatives of patient to check the status of patient health remotely. .
- The system also introduced a function through which a doctor will able to check the status of patient after a certain interval of time by sending message.
- The aim of patient monitoring is to give warning of early or dangerous deterioration and to achieve this by obtaining an optimal compromise involving many design factors, clinical, engineering and economic.
- The main objective is to design a Patient Monitoring System to diagnose the health condition of the patients.

- ` `Giving care and health assistance to the bed ridden patients at critical stages with advanced medical facilities have become one of the major problems in the modern hectic world. 

- In hospitals where a large number of patients whose physical conditions have to be monitored frequently as a part of diagnostic procedure, the need for a cost effective and fast responding alert mechanism is inevitable. 

- Proper implementation of such systems can provide timely warnings to the medical staffs and doctors and their service can be activated in case of medical emergencies.

**FEATURES:**

- Atmega328 Microcontroller: The microcontroller is used as a central processing unit for monitoring the body temperature and all the operations of input outputs in the circuit.
- LCD Display: This is used to display the pictorial representation of the measured inputs and output signals.
- Heartbeat Sensor: The device utilizes optical technology to measure heartbeat of patient
- Temperature Sensor: The temperature monitoring unit consists of the components that are required to measure the temperature of the body.
- Transformer: It is used to power the GSM modem.
- GSM Modem: The GSM based Patient health monitoring system works with GSM modem to send the data remotely to the registered number, system powered by transformer.
- Buzzer: It is used to give the output signals and emergency signals through the sound.
- Resistors: It is used to provide the constant supply through the devices.
- Capacitors: condition monitoring is a vital process to estimate the health status of capacitors and to provide predictive maintenance for ensuring stability in the operation of power converter systems.
- Diodes: This is mainly used to Conducting an electric current in one direction.


**SWOT ANALYSIS:**

- It is fully automated system and does not require any human attention.
- Automatic alert system using a buzzer gives intimation to user. 
- GSM interfacing provides a feature of remote monitoring of patient health parameters 
- In a hospital, either the nurse or the doctor has to move physically from one person to another for health check, which may not be possible to monitor their conditions continuously.
- Thus any critical situations cannot be found easily unless the nurse or doctor checks the person’s health at that moment. Reduces strain of the doctors who have to take care of a lot number of people in the hospital. Increase efficiency
- The number of nurses required for keeping a check on patients in ICU can be reduced to a large extent. More Accurate.
- Chances of human error in checking different health parameters is also reduced, also the database can be updated time to time.

**WEAKNESS:**

- Without the patient's willingness to be an active participant in their care, Real-Time Health Monitoring Devices implementation will likely fail.
- Cost is also a barrier to its widespread use. 
- There is a lack of reimbursement guidelines for services, which may deter its incorporation into clinical practice.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

- Wide variety of sensors are used in the devices to monitor the patient vitals ranging from heart rate, body temperature, ECG, Respiration, Non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation etc. 
- The deployment of wireless health monitoring removes the geographical barriers in getting specialist care.
- GSM module and the various sensors used in this investigation provide a simple monitoring method which does not require a smartphone or internet connectivity. 
- Using GSM module facilitates the sending and receiving of information regardless of distances.

**THREATS:**

- **Security and privacy**: Security and privacy remain a major concern deterring users from using embedded technology for medical purposes, as healthcare solutions have the potential to be breached or hacked.
- **Risk of failure**: Failure or bugs in the hardware or even power failure can impact the performance of sensors and connected equipment placing healthcare operations at risk.
- **Cost**: While it promises to reduce the cost of healthcare in the long-term, the cost of its implementation in hospitals and staff training is quite high.

**4W’S &1H:**

**WHO:** 

- This project can be used in home for patients or ill person or old person to monitor their health parameters.
- Same project can be used in hospitals.

**WHAT:** 

- The GSM based Patient health monitoring system works with GSM modem to send the data remotely to the registered number, system powered by transformer. .
- The system also introduced a function through which a doctor will able to check the status of patient after a certain interval of time by sending message.

**WHEN:** 

- GSM based Patient Health Monitoring Project mainly works for allowing doctors or relatives of patient to check the status of patient health remotely. 
- The system calculates the heartbeats and body temperature of patient and if it goes above certain limit then immediate informative alert message will be sent to the registered number

**WHERE:**

- It is mainly used in the hospitals as well as in the emergency wards so that the continuous monitoring of patient is done. It can also be used in the home as well as a kit in the house products. And mainly in every pharmaceutical areas.

**HOW:**

- The wirelesses sensors are placed in the patient's body are ECG sensors, high temperature, which detects if any abnormal condition and sends message using the GSM to the particular person's caretaker. 
- The aim of this project is developing a novel system for monitor the health conditions of patients.
